Syntia "If I back you up now..." >> Maybe have her voice shaking, like she's contemplating the unthinkable (Similar to the line : the doctor said.... that you did)

"You’ll get better. We have all the time in the world." >> possibly needs to be more merry / happy / joking

Syntia "I can't believe you can still joke at times like this. It's like you don't even care your own body is disintegrating." >> needs to sound more annoyed / stern
